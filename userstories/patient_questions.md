- is the encryption key encrypted using the **public key** or using the **password**?
- Should the private key and encrypted key be decrypted **before** or **after** being sent to the user? Or remain on **server** side entirely?
- Can a user invited to read and update the data of another user (like a doctor) **delete** this data?
